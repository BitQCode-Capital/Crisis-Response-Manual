# 🧾 Post-Mortem Report : Manual Mismatch - Binance Position Closure Limitation - Active API Key Deletion

**Date:** 24-10-2025 

**Service:** Crypto Algorithmic Trading (Binance Futures) - M.G.

**Incident:** Exchange Rejection on Position Closure — `SOL/USDT:USDT`

**Severity:** Medium to High (Exchange-Driven Delay)

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes


---

## 🧩 **Summary**

During an automated short position closure on **Binance Futures**, the exchange unexpectedly **rejected a standard market-close order**, returning:

```
{"code": -4005, "msg": "Quantity greater than max quantity."}
```

This error originated from Binance’s internal **maximum order-size limitation**, which was not clearly documented or communicated through public API references.
As a result, the system’s initial request—well within typical operational parameters—was declined by the exchange.

A temporary workaround was deployed that submitted several smaller orders sequentially, which Binance accepted without issue.

---

## ⚠️ **Incident Details**

The incident was triggered by a manual test position placed within the firm’s internal matching engine (for documentation and screenshot purposes). The mismatch caused the internal matching logic to enter a large short position on Binance Futures.

The major incident was **Binance’s restrictive and hidden quantity limits**, which prevented a valid market close order from executing.
Our trading infrastructure performed as designed, handling authentication, risk checks, and order logic correctly.

During the event, an API key deletion was performed with the intention of safeguarding capital as an emergency response. While this action prevented further unintended trades, it also triggered additional errors in the strategy execution, as the system was unable to access account data or place corrective orders.

The new **chunk-based submission method** serves as a contingency for similar exchange-side limitations, ensuring uninterrupted trade execution even when external APIs behave unexpectedly.

### **Exchange Response**

* Error code: **–4005**
* Message: *“Quantity greater than max quantity.”*
* Behavior: Binance refused the closing order despite sufficient balance, margin, and account permissions.
* Impact: Position remained open for several minutes until smaller requests were accepted.

## 🧠 **Resolution**

To mitigate Binance’s restrictive order handling, a **chunk-based closing mechanism** was implemented:

* The total quantity (8,486.84 SOL) was split into smaller sub-orders (≈400 SOL each).
* Each chunk was sent sequentially with rate-limit-friendly timing.
* Binance successfully processed all partial orders.

This approach fully neutralized the position while working **within the exchange’s undocumented limitations**.

| Area                     | Description                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exchange Reliability** | Binance’s API unexpectedly enforced a hidden quantity cap. |
| **Trading Operations**   | Temporary delay in closing the short position.             |
| **Capital Exposure**     | Slightly extended risk window due to exchange rejection.   |
| **Internal Systems**     | Functionality confirmed stable; failure caused externally. |

## 🪶 **Summary Statement**

Documentation, screenshots, and API key validations for new APIs must be completed before live trading. Support teams should be contacted, and all relevant parameters fixed prior to trading start — not during live execution. 

 A formal pre-trading API key check protocol must be implemented, including: verifying connectivity, permissions, account balances, and performing optional test orders. Sub-accounts or API keys must not be changed/deleted mid-strategy to avoid unexpected errors in trade operations , Emergency API key actions should be accompanied by pre-defined fail-safe protocols, clear communication to all support teams to minimize secondary errors.
