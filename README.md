# Crisis-Response-Manual

Centralized SOPs and workflows for emergency response and escalation.


### Standard Operating Procedures for Extreme Events and Disruptions

This repository contains **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** designed to guide our team in responding to **all types of extreme events and operational disruptions** within our crypto algorithmic trading operations.
Our goal is to **ensure resilience, minimize downtime, and protect capital** during any incident that impacts trading performance, system integrity, or exchange connectivity.

---

## 🔧 Scope

These SOPs cover procedures for identifying, mitigating, and recovering from the following categories of issues:

* **Exchange Limitations** — Handling rate limits, trading suspensions, maintenance windows, and order book freezes.
* **API Errors** — Managing authentication failures, throttling, timeouts, and malformed responses.
* **Exchange Errors** — Responding to mismatched balances, trade discrepancies, or downtime on partner exchanges.
* **Operations Errors** — Addressing workflow interruptions, deployment mistakes, and failed batch processes.
* **Code Errors** — Debugging runtime failures, logic bugs, and model output anomalies affecting live trading.
* **Employee Errors** — Escalation, incident reporting, and post-mortem analysis for human errors in production.

---

## ⚙️ Objectives

* Maintain **continuous trading operations** and minimize exposure during disruptions.
* Provide **clear, actionable steps** for every failure scenario.
* Ensure **auditability** and **post-incident accountability**.
* Promote a culture of **resilience and operational discipline**.


---

## 🚨 Usage

These documents are to be followed **during live incidents or simulated drills**.
All incidents must be logged, reviewed, and incorporated into continuous improvement cycles.

> **Note:** This repository does not contain trading algorithms or proprietary code. It exists solely to maintain our firm’s operational continuity and incident response documentation.
