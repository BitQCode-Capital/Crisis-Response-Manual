# Crisis-Response-Manual


This repository contains **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** designed to guide our team in responding to **all types of extreme events and operational disruptions** within our crypto algorithmic trading operations.


---

## ðŸ”§ Scope

These SOPs cover procedures for identifying, mitigating, and recovering from the following categories of issues:

* **Exchange Limitations** â€” Handling rate limits, trading suspensions, maintenance windows, and order book freezes.
* **API Errors** â€” Managing authentication failures, throttling, timeouts, and malformed responses.
* **Exchange Errors** â€” Responding to mismatched balances, trade discrepancies, or downtime on partner exchanges.
* **Operations Errors** â€” Addressing workflow interruptions, deployment mistakes, and failed batch processes.
* **Code Errors** â€” Debugging runtime failures, logic bugs, and model output anomalies affecting live trading.
* **Employee Errors** â€” Escalation, incident reporting, and post-mortem analysis for human errors in production.

## ðŸš¨ Usage

These documents are to be followed **during live incidents or simulated drills**.
All incidents must be logged, reviewed, and incorporated into continuous improvement cycles.

> **Note:** This repository does not contain trading algorithms or proprietary code. It exists solely to maintain our firmâ€™s operational continuity and incident response documentation.
